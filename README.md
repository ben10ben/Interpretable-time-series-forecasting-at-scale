# RT1_TFT

Repo for colaborative work of Benedikt Rein, Yulia and Alican


This repository provides the code, nessesary for the linked paper.

We are trying to reproduce the performance of the TFT model, shown in the Google paper.

Once a MAE is reached that is less than a magnitude higher than this of the Google paper, we will start implementing other statistical or ML models, once those perform in a comparable magnitude we will implement a third dataset.


Run the setup.sh scrit to:
  -create needed directory structure
  -download the needed datasets
  -setup a conda enviroment
  -run a script for each dataset
  -compare the performance of the models
